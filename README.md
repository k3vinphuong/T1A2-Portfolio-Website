Introducing my portfolio and showcasing my ability to create a website using my knowledge of everything I have learnt. Topics that will be present in this portfolio include:

- Being able to create a README.md file
- Creating a sitemap to show the different pages and their layout on both a desktop and mobile view
- Making a video explaining the different features on our portfolio
- Showcasing our knowledge through the use of HTML and CSS to decorate and make our website

## Functionality/features

To allow the webpage to function properly and seaminglessly to provide the best possible user experience

---

## Sitemap

![Sitemap Link](./docs/Sitemap.png")

The sitemap provided above shows that the main home page will be the hub for everything else and other pages will be accessible from the home page through the nav bar. From the navbar, the personality, blogs and skills page can be accessed. The blog page which can be accessed from the navbar contains all the blogs from blog 1 through to blog 5.

## Wireframes

Wireframes for both desktop and mobile view were created through the use of Figma. These wireframes show the difference between each view and allowed us as creators to have a better visualisation on what our actual webpage should look like.

### Page Explanation: Homepage

The hompage is the most simplistic design having a header, main body with a title and a footer. The heading includes a navbar which leads to all the pages and the other pages can be accessed through this navbar. The Main body includes an image as the background and a title which includes the page developers name and a simple introduction. The footer is compiled of the webpage developers contact details and professional sources including their email, contact information, Github profile, Linkedin and resume.

### Page Explanation: Personality

This page is similar to the homepage in that it includes the same navbar in the header and the same footer. The difference which this page is there is text that is included in the main body. The same technique of having an image in the background is evident. The use of coloured boxes helps to better emphasis the text that is included on the page with their individual titles.

### Page Explanation: Blogs

This page is the most different page with a very different layout compared to the others. The same navbar in the header is still applied and the same footer however the main difference is in the body. The blogs are showed in a polaroid photo format with an image followed by the title and explanation in a white background shown only on the desktop view.
